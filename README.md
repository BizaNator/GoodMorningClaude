# ☀️ Good Morning, Claude

**One command reopens all of yesterday's work.** Persist and resume Claude Code sessions across restarts -- save all your active sessions at end of day, reopen them all in the morning with full context.

Supports tabs, panes, grid layouts, separate windows, and remote SSH sessions. Tab mode by default lets you drag windows out if you want :)

## 🎯 About BrainDeadGuild

**BrainDeadGuild** started in 2008 as a gaming community and evolved into a collaboration of gamers, streamers, AI creators, and game developers. We're focused on:

- 🎮 **Game Development** -- UEFN / Fortnite projects
- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Creation** -- tools and workflows
- 📺 **BrainDead.TV** -- shared lore, characters, and worlds (including the City of Brains universe)

The tools we release (like this one) are built for our own game and content pipelines, then shared openly when they're useful to others.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
End of day:                          Next morning:
+-----------------------+            +------------------------+
| Claude Code (Proj A)  |--/goodnight-->|                        |
| Claude Code (Proj B)  |--/goodnight-->|  session-registry.json |
| Claude Code (SSH: C)  |--/goodnight-->|  (central manifest)    |
+-----------------------+            +------------+-----------+
                                                  |
                                       claude-goodmorning
                                                  |
                                     +------------v-----------+
                                     | WT Tab: Proj A + ctx   |
                                     | WT Tab: Proj B + ctx   |
                                     | WT Tab: SSH -> C + ctx |
                                     +------------------------+
```

## 📦 Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/BizaNator/GoodMorningClaude.git
cd GoodMorningClaude
.\Install.ps1
```

The installer handles:
- 📝 `/goodnight` and `/goodmorning` slash commands -> `~\.claude\commands\`
- 📜 `claude-goodmorning.ps1` and `claude-sessions.ps1` -> `~\.local\bin\` (or custom path)
- 📁 Creates `~\.claude-sessions\` storage directory
- 🔤 Adds UTF-8 BOM to scripts (required for PowerShell 5.1)
- 🔓 Sets ExecutionPolicy to RemoteSigned if needed
- 🛡️ Removes Zone.Identifier from downloaded files (Unblock-File)
- 📍 Adds script directory to PATH if needed
- 🎨 Optionally installs Windows Terminal color schemes and profile

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"File cannot be loaded... not digitally signed"**
Scripts downloaded from the internet get a Zone.Identifier that blocks execution under RemoteSigned policy. The installer runs `Unblock-File` automatically. If you hit this manually:
```powershell
Unblock-File ~\.local\bin\claude-goodmorning.ps1
Unblock-File ~\.local\bin\claude-sessions.ps1
```

**"The string is missing the terminator" or other parse errors**
PowerShell 5.1 reads `.ps1` files as Windows-1252 unless they have a UTF-8 BOM. Non-ASCII characters (em dashes, box drawing) get silently corrupted into smart quotes, breaking the parser. The installer adds a BOM automatically. If you copy scripts manually, ensure they have a UTF-8 BOM.

**"Raw mode is not supported" from Claude Code**
This happens if you pipe content into `claude` (e.g., `$content | claude`). Claude Code needs a real TTY for its interactive UI. The goodmorning script avoids this by using a `.cmd` launcher and passing `/goodmorning <path>` as the initial prompt instead of piping.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📋 Use -help for a list of all commands

![image-20260206122745143](README.assets/image-20260206122745143.png)

### 🌙 End of Day -- Save Sessions

Inside each Claude Code session:

```
/goodnight                        # Save session with auto-detected context
/goodnight focusing on auth bug   # Add a note for tomorrow
```

This creates a structured markdown file in `~\.claude-sessions\` and registers the session in `session-registry.json`. Works for both local and SSH sessions -- the host is recorded automatically.

### ☀️ Next Morning -- Resume Everything

From PowerShell:

```powershell
claude-goodmorning                # Spawn ALL active sessions as WT tabs
claude-goodmorning -List          # See what's registered without spawning
claude-goodmorning -Pick          # Interactive: choose which to spawn
claude-goodmorning -DryRun        # Preview what would happen
claude-goodmorning -Session "C:\...\.claude-sessions\2026-02-05_myproject.md"
claude-goodmorning -Open          # Open sessions folder in Explorer
claude-goodmorning -Help          # Full usage info
```

Options:

```powershell
claude-goodmorning -Panes "2x4"   # 2-row x 4-column grid layout
claude-goodmorning -Panes 4       # 4 side-by-side columns (1 row)
claude-goodmorning -Windows       # Separate windows instead of tabs
claude-goodmorning -Delay 5       # 5 second pause between spawns
claude-goodmorning -NoSkipPermissions  # Don't pass --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Each session opens in a new Windows Terminal tab/pane with:
- 📂 Correct working directory (local) or SSH connection (remote)
- 💬 `/goodmorning` command auto-sent as first message to load context
- ⚡ `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (disable with `-NoSkipPermissions`)
- 🎨 Unique color scheme per pane for visual identification
- 🏷️ Pane title showing session name (`--suppressApplicationTitle`)

### 📋 Manage Sessions

```powershell
claude-sessions                   # List active sessions
claude-sessions -All              # Show all including done
claude-sessions -Done "myproject" # Remove a project from registry
claude-sessions -Remove 2         # Remove entry #2
claude-sessions -Clean            # Remove entries with missing files
claude-sessions -Open             # Open sessions folder in Explorer
claude-sessions -Help             # Full usage info
```

### 🔄 Inside a Running Session

If you opened Claude Code manually (not via `claude-goodmorning`):

```
/goodmorning                      # Load context for current project
/goodmorning C:\path\to\session.md  # Load a specific session file
```

## 🔲 Pane Grid Layout

The `-Panes "RxC"` option arranges sessions in a grid within a single Windows Terminal tab:

![image-20260206122631892](README.assets/image-20260206122631892.png)

```
-Panes "2x4" with 8 sessions:
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Sess 1 | Sess 2 | Sess 3 | Sess 4 |    (Claude Teal, Purple, Amber, Emerald)
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Sess 5 | Sess 6 | Sess 7 | Sess 8 |    (Claude Red, Violet, Cyan, Gold)
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
```

If you have more sessions than fit in one grid, additional tabs are created automatically. Plain `-Panes 4` creates a single row of 4 columns.

![image-20260206122528499](README.assets/image-20260206122528499.png)

## 🎨 Windows Terminal Setup

The installer can optionally configure Windows Terminal with:

**"Claude Session" profile** -- Hidden profile with `suppressApplicationTitle: true` so pane titles stick.

**8 custom color schemes** -- Subtle tinted dark backgrounds for visual identification:

| Scheme | Background | Accent |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| 🟦 Claude Teal | `#0D2830` | `#2D7D9A` |
| 🟪 Claude Purple | `#1A1028` | `#8B5CF6` |
| 🟧 Claude Amber | `#281E0D` | `#D97706` |
| 🟩 Claude Emerald | `#0D2818` | `#059669` |
| 🟥 Claude Red | `#280D0D` | `#DC2626` |
| 💜 Claude Violet | `#1A0D28` | `#7C3AED` |
| 🩵 Claude Cyan | `#0D2228` | `#0891B2` |
| 💛 Claude Gold | `#28200D` | `#CA8A04` |

Each pane gets a different scheme automatically. All schemes share the same VSCode-like foreground palette so code readability is identical.

If you skip the WT setup during install, the scripts still work -- they just won't apply color schemes or custom titles.

## 📁 File Structure

```
%USERPROFILE%\.claude-sessions\
+-- session-registry.json              # Central manifest of all active sessions
+-- 2026-02-05_bdrp-props-system.md    # Session snapshots (slug-based filenames)
+-- 2026-02-05_brainmon-dashboard.md
+-- 2026-02-06_bdrp-props-system.md    # New save = new file, old one stays as history
```

### 📄 Registry Format

```json
[
  {
    "sessionName": "BDRP -- Props System",
    "sessionSlug": "bdrp-props-system",
    "projectName": "braindeadrp",
    "projectPath": "C:\\P4\\BrainDeadRP",
    "host": "",
    "resumePath": "C:\\Users\\BizaNator\\.claude-sessions\\2026-02-05_bdrp-props-system.md",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "lastUpdated": "2026-02-05T18:30:00"
  },
  {
    "sessionName": "BrainMon -- Dashboard",
    "sessionSlug": "brainmon-dashboard",
    "projectName": "brainmon",
    "projectPath": "/opt/BrainMon",
    "host": "home@brainz",
    "resumePath": "C:\\Users\\BizaNator\\.claude-sessions\\2026-02-05_brainmon-dashboard.md",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "lastUpdated": "2026-02-05T22:00:00"
  }
]
```

Multiple sessions can share the same `projectPath` -- each gets a unique `sessionSlug`. Registry matches on slug, not project name.
